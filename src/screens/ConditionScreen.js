                        <li>An invoice shall be produced by the Supplier to the Buyer in accordance with the terms set out in the Purchase Order. The Buyer shall pay for the goods and/or services at the end of the month following the month in which the goods and/or services are supplied or in which the invoice is received, whichever is the later. In no circumstances shall the time for payment be of the essence of the Agreement. This only applies to account customers. All other purchases are to be paid with cleared funds before despatch.</li>
                        <li>The Buyer shall not be responsible for any expenses, charges or price other than those set out in the Purchase Order.</li>

                        <li>If the parties agree that the Supplier is to provide goods and/or services or resources in addition to those specified in a Purchase Order, then such agreement will be reflected in a further Purchase Order, which will be deemed incorporated into this Agreement.</li>

                        <li>Items repaired or replaced shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions in the same manner as those originally delivered under this Agreement.
